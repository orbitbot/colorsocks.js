colorsocks.js
=============

A tiny Javascript helper for alternating color strings on the web

> Your attitude is like a box of crayons that color your world. Constantly color your picture gray, and your picture will always be bleak. Try adding some bright colors to the picture by including humor, and your picture begins to lighten up.  
>  -- Allen Klein

[See colorsocks.js in a DEMO](http://orbitbot.github.io/colorsocks.js/). Try reloading a bit for fun :)

## Get

If you have [bower](http://bower.io/) installed (if you don't, you probably want to but just haven't heard about it yet), run

```bash
$ bower install colorsocks.js
```


Otherwise you can download either [```colorsocks.js```](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orbitbot/colorsocks.js/master/dist/colorsocks.js) or the minfied [```colorsocks.min.js```](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orbitbot/colorsocks.js/master/dist/colorsocks.min.js). Just click. Or look in the ```dist/``` subfolder.

<br />

## Use

colorsocks.js attaches itself to the ```window``` as ```window.colorsocks``` and exposes a single function:

#### _colorsocks.paint(elementId, colorsArray, text)_
```
elementId   : required, the id of the html element that should get colorized
colorsArray : required, an array of colors in HTML notation to apply to the string,
              eg. ['#f5dd1b', '#20d0e8', '#ea3487', '#96294d']
text        : optional, the text to fill the element with. If omitted, colorsocks 
              will use the element's existing innerText as the source string.
```

<br />

**N.B.** The DOM element that should have some more color applied to it should exist before ```colorsocks.paint()``` is called, so hook into either ```window.onload``` or ```$( document ).ready()``` for jQuery.

A full example can be found in the ```example/``` subfolder in this repository.
